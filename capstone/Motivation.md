# Motivation for using NLP for my project

## Motivation  
I have decided for an NLP project for the following reasons:  
* I am working with healthcare data and the usage of NLP is becoming more prevalent for extracting knowledge from documents like physician notes. As such I believe it is strategic in getting some additional learning/education in this area.
* I have background in NLP and I do believe I can leverage it while also learning more advanced techniques and libraries (such as the usage of embeddings and libraries as Spacy).  

## Advanced and fast NLP with Spacy  
Spacy is an open-source library for Natural Language Processing in Python. SpaCy provides a rich library of tools for NLP and manages the end-to-end processing of text.  

Spacy allows for usage of transformation pipelines (the text becomes a doc object that is processed using a multistep approach (tagger, a lemmatizer, a parser and an entity recognizer).  
Spacy allows for usage of different pre-trained language models saving a lot of work while applying it to a particular language domain (like medical text).  

Spacy allows for further project evolution by using word embeddings, one of the newest and most advanced evolutions in NLP.  Spacy supports a number of transfer and multi-task learning workflows that can often help improve your pipelineâ€™s efficiency or accuracy.
